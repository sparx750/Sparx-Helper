## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can run this script in two main ways. The bookmarklet method is highly recommended as it's the easiest to reuse.

### Method 1: Bookmarklet (Recommended)

1.  **Copy the Script**: Copy the entire JavaScript code provided.
2.  **Create a New Bookmark**: Right-click your browser's bookmarks bar and select "Add page..." or "Add bookmark...".
3.  **Name It**: Give the bookmark a memorable name, like `Sparx Helper`.
4.  **Paste the Code**: In the **URL** or **Address** field, type `javascript:` and then **paste the entire copied script immediately after it**.

    > **IMPORTANT**: The `javascript:` prefix is essential. The final URL should look like this:
    > ```javascript
    > javascript:(function () { /*...all your code here... */ })();
    > ```

5.  **Save**: Save the bookmark.

Now, whenever you are on a Sparx reading page, just click this bookmark to launch the helper.

### Method 2: Developer Console

1.  Navigate to the Sparx page where you want to use the helper.
2.  Open your browser's Developer Tools (press `F12`, or `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows/Linux, or `Cmd+Opt+I` on Mac).
3.  Go to the **Console** tab.
4.  Copy and paste the entire script into the console.
5.  Press `Enter`.

> *Note: This method is temporary. You will need to repeat this process every time you reload the page.*

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Launch**: Run the script using one of the installation methods above.
2.  **Enter Password**: A password prompt will appear. Enter `CHEATS` and click **UNLOCK**.

### Manual Workflow

This gives you full control over each step.

2.  **Get Answer for Question**: Once a question appears, click this button. The script will use the stored passage and the current question to ask the AI for the answer.
    *   The answer will appear in the top-left card.
    *   The script will **automatically click the correct answer button** on the page for you.
3.  Repeat step 2 for all questions in the set.

    *   Perform the initial passage setup.
    *   Process every question for that passage.
    *   Click the main "Next" button to load the next passage.
    *   Repeat the entire cycle.
3.  **Stop the Script**: To stop the process, click the **"Stop Automatic"** button or press the `Esc` key.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Disclaimers

*   **API Key**: This script contains a hardcoded Google Gemini API key. This key is public and may have usage limits or be disabled at any time. For reliable, long-term use, you should get your own free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and replace the one in the script:
    ```javascript
    // Find this line in the script and replace the key
    const geminiApiKey = 'YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE';
    ```
*   **Academic Integrity**: This tool is a proof-of-concept and is intended for educational purposes only. Using this script to cheat on assignments is a violation of academic integrity policies and is strongly discouraged.
*   **Website Changes**: This script relies on specific selectors and text on the Sparx website (e.g., `button.sr_...`, "Start reading here"). If Sparx updates its website, the script may break. It may require updates to the selectors in the code to function again.
*   **Authorized Users**: The script has a hardcoded list of names (Jack Sigma, Alex yenzab etc) it checks for on the page before running. If none of these names are present, it will display an "Access Denied" message.
So this is what  you may need to do go to content.js and go to line 238 where you have to put your full name. TO GET ACESS.
